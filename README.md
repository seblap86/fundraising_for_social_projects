# Trends and opportunities in fundraising for social projects
## Ironhack midterm project by Sebastian Bobeth and Juliane Petersen
- Type: BI project
- Project status: Actice

## Project description
#### Project aim
To provide a consulting service for social entrepreneurs seeking to pitch their project on fundraising platforms. We will focus on presenting an overview of trends and success criteria using the following features:
- Categories/topics
- Project location
- Funding targets (numerical and in ranges)
- Funding timeline
- Funding raised (absolute and relative to funding target)
- Number of supporters
- Optional: Project description length, keywords   

The visualization aim is to create an interactive dashboard targeted at aspiring social entrepreneurs. A secondary project aim is to build a linear regression model to determine the most relevant success predictors (target variable: % of funding target reached), if time allows for that.
