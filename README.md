# Trends and opportunities in fundraising for social projects
## Midterm project by Sebastian Bobeth and Juliane Petersen
- Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, Berlin, November 2023
- Type: BI project
- Project status: Finalized

## Project description
#### Project aim
To provide a consulting service for social entrepreneurs seeking to pitch their project on fundraising platforms. We developed an overview of trends and success criteria by conducting explorative data analysis (EDA) on the following features:
- Categories/topics
- Project location
- Funding targets (numerical and in ranges)
- Funding raised (absolute and relative to funding target)
- Number of supporters
- Project description length.   

As it was our visualization aim, we created an interactive dashboard targeted at aspiring social entrepreneurs that integrated this information.

#### Tech used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook (Data wrangling, explorative data analysis)
- SQL (Model building)
- Tableau (Explorative data analysis, data visualization, interactive dashboard creation & publication)
